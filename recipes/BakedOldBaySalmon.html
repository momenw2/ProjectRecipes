    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Classic Old Bay seasoning makes this fresh salmon recipe pop with flavor! And the simple oven-roasting method
        couldn’t be easier. I’m positive this Old Bay Roasted Salmon will become a regular on your menu!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> serving cooking spray</li>
        <li> (2 pound) salmon fillet</li>
        <li> tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li> tablespoons seafood seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Oven, Pan, and Fillets. Preheat the oven to 450˚F. While it heats, generously grease a baking
            sheet or pan with cooking spray. Then place the fillets, skin side down, on the baking sheet, and brush them
            with olive oil</li>
        <li>Combine the Seasonings and Rub Onto the Fillets. In a small mixing bowl, blend the Old Bay seasoning, garlic
            powder, onion powder, dill weed, and parsley; mix well to combine. Rub this spice mixture onto the fillets,
            all around the top and sides. There’s no need to season the skin side.</li>
        <li>Roast! Bake the fillets for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they flake easily with a fork. You can also use an
            instant read thermometer to check for doneness; salmon is cooked through when internal temperature registers
            at 145˚F.</li>

    </ol>
